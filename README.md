# XFrFT
X-ray wavefront propagation simulation package using the fractional Fourier transform.

The technique is described in more detail in the journal article:  
"The fractional Fourier transform as a simulation tool for lens-based X-ray microscopy".

To get started with this simulation tool I would recommend starting with the examples. They start out with very simple simulation geometries and advance to more complex setups, including compound refractive lenses, where this technique has great benefits. The examples referring to figures are examples to reproduce the simulation results in the journal article above.
